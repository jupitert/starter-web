The track called Munnal Kadhali penned by Madhan Karky and sung by Vishal Dadlani and Sharanya Gopinath has caught on the attention for its positivity towards love failure. At a time when women bashing with the choicest epithets seems to be the ‘cool’ thing, here are Karky’s lines which look at the entire episode of ‘love failure’ in the most sorted, matured and practical manner. His lines are positive; there is sorrow being expressed but there is no bitterness. Life has to move on, is the main motto of the song.
